AI-powered mobile website for farmers to detect potato diseases instantly using CNN, ensuring timely action, reducing crop losses, and boosting productivity for sustainable agriculture. To improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting, we integrated an image generator for data augmentation. This technique artificially increases dataset size by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustments, making the model more robust to variations in real-world images. As a result, farmers receive more accurate disease predictions, enhancing early intervention and cropÂ management.
